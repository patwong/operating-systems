p1:
looked into main.c, found string, modified string

p2:
looked at threads.c; contains DEBUG() fn
	- assumed thread_fork was to be called - WRONG; 
		- cannot call DEBUG() from another function
looked at kprintf.c - contains dbflags, but only menu.c can be changed
looked at lib.h - contains various flags for DEBUG()
	- 0x10 is for DB_THREADS
	- dbflags=16 (external shared var) in menu.c
	- success
